# PrimoLogger
A JavaFX based GUI application that I've made to read [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html) logs, and uses the export files generated 
from the [2022 Data Log Tool](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html#on-robot-telemetry-recording-into-data-logs), or the [Shuffleboard GUI's recording feature.](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html#on-robot-telemetry-recording-into-data-logs) And displays the changes of values over the time of the recording.
This application is aimed at FRC teams that want to have a simple way to view and debug their robot issues, created during the Rapid React 2021-2022 Season, originally for my robotics team - Primo (4586)

The most recent version currently being the experiemntal version of the [Experimental WPI-Data Log version ](https://github.com/danielml2/PrimoLogger/releases/tag/v0.0.2-wpidatacsv) which added the option to load the new data log files.
Currently, the version that's on the main branch **ONLY supports Shuffleboard recordings**, as the data log version isn't quite clean yet, and has a bit of a memory issue.
